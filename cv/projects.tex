	{TEX - Personal Trade Execution System}{current}
  {TEX is a fully automated Python based personal trading system. It uses stock
  price data to predict returns and execute trades on my behalf. It also publishes
  results to a UI in order for me to track the investments. I created TEX due to
  my interests in the financial markets, just for fun.}
